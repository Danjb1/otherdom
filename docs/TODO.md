 - Ability to change terrain elevation

 - Fog

 - 3d models (e.g. trees)

 - Animated water

 - Reduce duplication in TerrainSection

 - Reduce duplication in Renderers

 - Clean up / clarify / comment the various shaders

 - Separate VBO construction from object representation (e.g. TerrainSection)

 - Unit tests
